# SkyWarsReloaded
The most popular Skywars plugin ever built for Spigot and Bukkit!

This plugin is based off the of the old SkywarsReloaded plugin (4.1.3), but adds more features, fixes, and 1.14-1.16 support! You can just update to this version without removing any of your current Skywars files. Everything works the same. Please note that the official/old Skywars plugin is no longer maintained. We will, however, continue to maintain this version until further notice!

Are you having trouble running the plugin?

**Get help in our Discord server!**
When asking for help, provide the necessary context required for people to help you. This includes one or more of the following:

1. Logs (most important part usually). We recommend that you use our own "paste" website to submit your logs
2. Partial logs are harder to work with than your entire log file, we need the most information about what's happening
3. An image or recording of your problem in-game, if possible.
4. A description of what you have already tried.. We don't want to waste your time.
